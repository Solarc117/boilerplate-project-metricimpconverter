# [Quality Assurance Projects](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/quality-assurance/#quality-assurance-projects)

My take on the last 5 projects from the [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/) Quality Assurance Projects.

I don't follow the tests strictly; I try to implement behaviour-and test-driven development; so long as I have the functionality, I think it's fine.
